A bear, a bucket and a bunch of friends is a recipe for freedom. 

This bunch is to be thanked commended for their bravery and big hearts!  
The one thing that might have made it a bit easier on the bear? Talking TO her instead of only about her. Reassuring her that all was well, and they were there to help.   
Well that's what I would have done, anyway! 

Even without specifically saying anything, a lot is going on at a non-verbal level with each person involved, and the bear without a doubt picked up on it.   
Thinking we can communicate our good intentions to this bear is one thing. What the bear might have to say in response is lost entirely when we don't consider the idea that communication is possible....  
If you ever find yourself in a situation like this, take a moment to tell the creature that you are there to help.   
Out loud or in your mind, it doesn't matter.

And see what happens. Meantime, thanks to the group of humans who saved this bear's life.   
You didn't have to, but you did, and that is a beautiful thing.
